NORTHEASTERN DASHBOARD - PROJECT SUMMARY

1) What this project is
This project is a React + Vite web dashboard that documents and analyzes Northeastern University innovation initiatives across the global campus network. It is designed to give leadership and campus teams a single, searchable, filterable view of initiatives, outcomes, and qualitative insights.

2) What was built
- A full dashboard UI composed of reusable React components.
- A centralized project dataset in `src/data/projectData.js`.
- Portfolio-level metrics cards for project count, large-scale initiatives, data availability, and campus footprint.
- Interactive analysis sections:
  - Strategic Focus Areas (9 theme categories)
  - Innovation Maturity Pipeline (Emerging, Growing, Mature)
  - Campus Network Distribution chart
  - Data Availability chart
  - Insights Hub with Common Challenges and Impact Themes
- Advanced filtering and exploration:
  - Text search (title, college, campus)
  - Campus filter
  - College/department filter (with normalization/grouping)
  - Maturity stage filter
  - Data status filter
  - Theme-based and qualitative-theme filters
- Expandable project table with detailed records and contact information.

3) Core data captured
Each project record contains:
- Metadata: title, college/department, campus, duration, reach, and data status
- Contacts: primary and secondary contact names/emails
- Qualitative intelligence fields:
  - description
  - problem/opportunity
  - challenges
  - impact
  - lessons learned
  - recognition
  - innovation type
  - target audience
  - partners
  - evaluation methods
  - data results
  - success metrics
  - additional info

4) Current dataset snapshot (from `projectData.js`)
- Total projects tracked: 100
- Campuses represented: 12
- Distinct college/department labels: 59

Reach distribution:
- 1-25: 19
- 26-100: 35
- 101-500: 23
- 501-1000: 13
- More than 1,000: 10

Duration distribution:
- Less than 6 months: 13
- 6 months - 1 year: 26
- 1-2 years: 25
- 2-3 years: 24
- More than 3 years: 12

Maturity distribution (derived from duration):
- Emerging: 39
- Growing: 49
- Mature: 12

Data status distribution:
- Yes - both quantitative and qualitative: 49
- Yes - quantitative data: 8
- Yes - qualitative data: 4
- No, but data collection is planned: 34
- No data available: 5

Dashboard-level data readiness rollup:
- Data Ready: 61
- Collection Planned: 34
- No Data: 5

5) How analysis is performed
- Strategic themes are computed through keyword logic plus explicit include/exclude title overrides.
- Qualitative challenge and impact themes are computed from text in challenges/impact fields with keyword logic and targeted include/exclude sets.
- Maturity stage is inferred from project duration:
  - Emerging: < 1 year
  - Growing: 1-3 years
  - Mature: > 3 years
- College names are normalized through `src/utils/collegeGrouping.js` to improve filter consistency.

6) Project outcome in plain terms
This project produced a working innovation intelligence platform that turns a large, mixed-methods portfolio (quantitative + qualitative) into a practical decision-support tool. It captures who is doing what, where initiatives are happening, how mature they are, what evidence exists, and what common patterns are emerging across campuses.

7) Notable implementation details
- Frontend stack: React 19, Vite 7, Chart.js + react-chartjs-2.
- Main app entry: `src/App.jsx` -> `src/components/Dashboard.jsx`.
- Dashboard sections are modular and independently maintainable.
- Existing `README.md` is still the default Vite template; this file serves as the project-level business summary.
