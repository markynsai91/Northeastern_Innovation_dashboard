        description: "The Neurodiversity Initiative at Northeastern works to transform the culture of higher education and the workplace by shifting toward a strength-based model of neurodiversity. The initiative provides comprehensive training for workplaces, managers, human resources, and talent acquisition teams on neuroinclusive practices that benefit all individuals. Faculty and staff receive support to adjust their pedagogy and curriculum to create more accessible learning environments. Student specialists provide weekly coaching throughout the co-op process, focusing on workplace readiness, campus belonging, self-advocacy, and executive functioning. Importantly, a diagnosis is not required for support, recognizing that access to diagnosis is a privilege not available to everyone.",

Students use AI as a creativity-enhancing tool while examining how this collaboration reshapes their understanding of authorship, originality, and critical thinking. The class begins with debates about whether machines can truly co-create literary work, grounding those questions in experimental traditions that use chance and constraint. Through a series of structured projects, students craft and iterate multi-step prompts, engage in dialogic exchanges with large language models, experiment with computational literature using Python to experience algorithmic structure firsthand, and design a culminating project composed of equal parts human- and AI-generated writing. In process notes and peer discussions, they articulate the ethical and aesthetic stakes of human–AI authored writing.",

This project responds to a clear pedagogical gap: students need direct, structured experiences that teach how to write, think, and make creative decisions with AI responsibly. The course reframes AI not as a threat to creativity or academic integrity, but as a catalyst for understanding collaboration, authorship, and agency.",
        challenges: "One of the main challenges has been navigating skepticism. Some colleagues remain unconvinced that AI can be used meaningfully in the humanities, and I've done a significant amount of work to begin addressing this in my public presentations. At the same time, students often arrive with polarized views: some see AI as a shortcut, while others avoid it altogether, fearing they’ll be punished for using it. Much of the early work in the course involves unlearning both of these habits of thought, creating a space where critical and creative experimentation can occur. Establishing a balance between openness, rigor, and ethical reflection continues to be one of the most challenging and rewarding parts of the process.",
        impact: "The most significant impact of Writing Creatively in the Age of AI has been on student learning and empowerment. Students leave the course not only trained in the practical use of AI tools, but with a deeper understanding of how these technologies can strengthen rather than replace their own voice, creativity, and productivity. They learn to approach AI critically, recognizing both its risks and its possibilities, and to see its use as an ongoing, lifelong process of learning and adaptation. In this way, the course helps students develop a sustainable and reflective practice that prepares them to navigate and shape the evolving landscape of creative and technological work.",

My research will explore when and how students experience their creative writing with AI more as a collaboration rather than a shortcut, and how creative-writing methodologies might serve as frameworks for teaching critical AI literacy more broadly.

Writing Creatively in the Age of AI grows out of the long legacy of the Mills College Creative Writing program and my own two decades in the classroom.

The training includes a series of seven Canvas modules ranging in topics from creating an inclusive SIG to event planning and budget request policies. We require that at least one student leader from each organization complete the training in its entirety and then we host a mandatory SIG Leader training session at the beginning of each semester to review the policies and share campus wide resources with students like Graduate Ombuds. This combination of asynchronous and in person training has helped to reinforce the guidelines that allow for efficient event planning with our IT and Operations Teams as well as allows Student Affairs to track active and inactive SIGs based on their completion of the module.",

        description: "Northeastern University Charlotte's Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (ABSN) program is designed to address North Carolina's critical nursing shortage by providing an accelerated pathway for career changers and second-degree students to earn a BSN in as few as 16 months. The program is unique in North Carolina, accepting students with either a non-nursing bachelor's degree or at least 62 college credits. Our state-of-the-art clinical training facilities include four advanced simulation rooms and a 10-bed skills lab that serve as safe, contextual learning environments where students integrate theory with practice while making real-time clinical decisions. The simulation rooms feature observation and control capabilities, allowing faculty to create realistic clinical scenarios with adjustable vitals and real-time patient interactions, including specialized high-fidelity manikins like \"simulation mom\" (capable of full birth delivery and obstetric emergencies) and \"simulation man\" (designed for elder care scenarios with challenging vascular access). These manikins can talk, communicate, able to swallow, and reproduce biological functions to realistically portray high-risk scenarios such as cardiac arrest or severe hemorrhaging, followed by reflective debriefing sessions where faculty provide feedback in a non-graded environment that encourages honest self-assessment. The program employs a robust part-time faculty network drawn primarily from our local hospital partners—including Atrium Health, CaroMont Health and Novant Health—creating a direct pipeline from education to employment while ensuring students learn from practicing clinicians. Our graduates excel in clinical practice and have also demonstrated success in entrepreneurship and innovation, extending nursing's impact beyond traditional clinical settings.",
        problem_opportunity: "North Carolina faces a severe nursing shortage that threatens healthcare access and quality across the state, with 13% of the state’s registered nurse positions currently unfilled. The ABSN program addresses this crisis by creating an accelerated, accessible pathway for individuals with existing college education to transition into nursing careers quickly and affordably. Traditional BSN programs require 2 years of nursing and often exclude qualified candidates due to limited faculty and clinical sites who already hold degrees or significant college credits in other fields. Our 16-month accelerated model recognizes and builds upon students' prior learning, reducing time to workforce entry while maintaining rigorous clinical preparation. By employing practicing nurses from our hospital partners as adjunct faculty, we ensure students learn current best practices while building relationships that facilitate employment transitions. Our advanced simulation facilities address the challenge of clinical preparedness by providing safe, controlled environments where students can practice complex scenarios—from high-risk obstetric emergencies to geriatric care—before encountering them with real patients.",
        challenges: "Regional competitors within the nursing preparation space",
        impact: "The most significant impact has been rapidly increasing the nursing workforce pipeline in North Carolina while maintaining exceptional educational quality and student diversity. By offering an accelerated 16-month pathway, we've made nursing education accessible to a broader population of career changers who bring valuable life experience and diverse perspectives to patient care, graduating over 500 nurses since 2017. Our simulation facilities—including four advanced simulation rooms and a 10-bed skills lab—have transformed how students develop clinical judgment and technical skills. The high-fidelity manikins like \"simulation mom\" and \"simulation man\"—which can talk, bleed, and reproduce biological functions—allow students to experience and respond to high-stakes scenarios such as cardiac arrest, severe hemorrhaging, and obstetric emergencies in safe, controlled environments before encountering them with actual patients. The reflective, non-graded debriefing sessions following each simulation create a psychologically safe space for students to honestly assess their performance and receive constructive feedback, building both competence and confidence. The employment of practicing nurses from our hospital partners as adjunct faculty has created a seamless education-to-employment pipeline, with many students securing positions at facilities where their instructors practice. This model ensures students learn current protocols and build professional networks during their education. Beyond traditional clinical roles, our graduates exemplify nursing's expanding impact, with alumni pursuing entrepreneurial ventures and innovative projects that leverage their clinical expertise to address healthcare challenges in novel ways. This demonstrates how our program prepares nurses who are not only clinically competent but also innovative thinkers ready to shape the future of healthcare delivery.",

Students form teams to build autonomous AI agents that compete in real-time challenges, with their performance visible to a live audience through dynamic visualizations and commentary. The inaugural event (July 2024) focused on building RAG-based trivia agents using Python that searched predetermined datasets to answer high-difficulty questions. The second iteration (November 2024) evolved to use n8n, a no-code platform, where students built agents capable of autonomously completing Kahoot quizzes by conducting deep research across the internet and interacting with web browsers. The format emphasizes accessibility (no prior coding or agent experience required), creative problem-solving, and transforms technical learning into an engaging spectator experience similar to e-sports competitions.",

Second, it creates meaningful peer connection and community building opportunities for graduate students in tech programs who often struggle to form networks due to the professional, transient nature of graduate education. Third, it transforms technical education into an entertainment experience by making AI development visible and exciting to broader audiences. The watch party format helps demystify AI for non-technical audiences while creating memorable, engaging experiences for participants.

Together with Curt Carlson, PhD, former CEO of SRI International (whose teams invented Siri and HDTV) and Professor of the Practice at Northeastern's CPS, we are customizing and launching the NU Innovation for Impact (i4i) value creation program. This innovative program combines a curriculum validated through hundreds of workshops with leading companies, universities, and government agencies and now augmented with AI Tutors that teach core value creation concepts. The program features two interconnected layers: 1) teaching the proven i4i value creation methodology and 2) enabling students to apply the value creation methodology themselves through experiential learning amplified by AI guidance. Throughout each class, AI Tutors teach students, faculty, and working professionals the core value creation concepts, helping them not just solve problems, but identify the unmet needs of others, a skill enhanced through repeated practice with the AI Tutors. This provides a unique opportunity to integrate AI Tutors for core value creation concepts into students' work experiences, allowing them to develop and present compelling value propositions to employers that demonstrate how they'll address real organizational needs. The approach is planned to be customized to Northeastern's Co-op and CPS's newly developed apprenticeship programs. Value Creation offers students the opportunity to stand out by showing they understand stakeholder needs and can collaborate effectively to meet them.",

Few have those skills today. This innovation addresses the critical gap between traditional education and the practical skill of creating value by identifying unmet needs, a fundamental competency for career success that students rarely develop systematically. The challenge is that truly mastering value creation requires repeated experiential practice, but traditional faculty resources are limited in providing individualized, iterative guidance. By integrating AI Tutors that teach core value creation concepts into Northeastern's unique Co-op and apprenticeship programs, students have an enhanced opportunity to practice identifying stakeholder needs and crafting value propositions multiple times before and during their work placements. This has the potential to transform students from task-completers into strategic problem-identifiers who can articulate clear value propositions to employers, demonstrating how they'll collaboratively understand and meet organizational needs, ultimately making them stand out in competitive professional settings.",

This actually goes well beyond the question on how to best pursue technology emerging from research activities from an entrepreneurial point of view.  In my view, it had an even bigger impact on our basic research culture. Many of us have adopted your \"need\" and \"critical insight\" centric approach in deciding which research areas to engage in the first place. Or even when publishing fundamental research results the focus has changed in the same way leading to fewer but higher impact publications. Even the way we run group meetings have changed significantly since we started with the NABC workshops.  I think it has significantly improved the quality of our research, the impact of our scientific publications and of course the quality of our grant applications. Some of these ideas I have also started to share with the Physics Department in the hope that new faculty members can benefit from this early on in their carriers.

Students report learning workplace-aligned skills but struggle to translate them into academic choices and career narratives; those who do not complete co-op are 1.7 times more likely to be underemployed.

Senior graduate students or alumni (mentors) will serve as role models and support mentees by sharing their experiences and perspectives of successful graduate life in Canada. The Program supports Northeastern’s commitment to improving student experiential learning and engagement by building a mentorship community, creating opportunities to enrich current students’ co-curricular experiences, and fostering academic and personal excellence. Through structured training, reflection, and sustained mentoring practice, learners (mentors) develop and demonstrate leadership, communication, problem-solving, coaching, and facilitation skills.",
        problem_opportunity: "The innovation addresses the challenges many new students face, especially considering Toronto's large international student population, when navigating the transition to graduate student life, including campus resources, academic expectations, and social integration. Students often feel isolated or overwhelmed without peer support systems, which can negatively impact their academic performance and sense of belonging. The Toronto Peer Mentorship Program offers the opportunity to build stronger student communities, scale the level and quality of student support at a global campus, and develop mentor leadership skills while providing mentees with accessible, relatable guidance during critical transition periods.",
        challenges: "One challenge has been maintaining consistent engagement from mentees throughout the entire term. Some mentor-mentee pairs start strong but lose momentum after the first few weeks, especially during busy periods like midterms and finals. We've also found that not all pairings click right away, and it can be difficult for students to communicate when a match isn't working for them. In terms of coordination, the program requires a high level of time, commitment, and personalized engagement with all mentors, as well as thoughtful matching and facilitation.",
        impact: "Many Toronto students have been involved in the program as either mentees or mentors over the last 4 years. The most significant impact has been the sense of belonging and community that participants report having developed through the program. Mentees consistently share that having someone who \"gets it\" and can relate to their concerns has made them feel less alone and more confident navigating campus/university life. Many mention that their mentor helped them navigate and discover resources or opportunities they would never have found on their own.   For mentors, we have seen growth in leadership capabilities and self-awareness. Mentors often tell us that being a mentor has improved their own time management, leadership, problem-solving, and communication skills.   We are also seeing mentors and mentees continuing to connect with one another after the term ends, having made new friends, with mentees already expressing interest in becoming mentors themselves. This creates a positive cycle where students who were once supported are now eager to give back, building a stronger and more connected campus community overall.",
        lessons_learned: "If we were starting over, we would build from the beginning more structured touch-points throughout the program, particularly with mentees. Additionally, we'd invest more time in ongoing mentor support and skill development, not just upfront training. This would include more opportunities for experienced peer mentors or staff members to share mentoring experiences and skills, and more designated workshops (like Graduate Leadership Institute/GLI) for structured competency development.",

Our mission is to empower all students, to create community, to foster well-being through inclusive experiential learning, and to enhance leadership competencies through intentional, hands-on co-curricular programming; for example, our Student Interest Groups ecosystem and the Graduate Leadership Institute (GLI). Student Interest Groups (SIGs) at Northeastern University's Toronto Campus is a platform designed to connect students who share common interests, goals, and passions. The initiative facilitates the creation and management of student-led groups that foster community building, enable meaningful collaboration, and organize engaging events across campus. By providing students with structured opportunities to connect beyond the classroom, SIGs help cultivate a stronger sense of belonging and create spaces where students can explore their interests alongside peers, guided by staff and faculty. Supported by Student Services, the SIGs streamline group discovery, membership management, and event coordination to make it easier for students to find their community and actively participate in campus life. To prepare for successful leadership, Student Services offers a variety of structured activities, trainings, and programming each year for SIG leaders, to support the cycle from kicking off the academic year, to providing skill development opportunities throughout, and wrapping up the year with shared reflections and appreciation.",
        problem_opportunity: "This innovation addresses the challenge many students face in finding meaningful connections, community, and leadership opportunities within university environments. Despite Northeastern's diverse student body, students often struggle to discover peers who share their specific interests on their own, and they wish to develop practical leadership and organizational skills outside the classroom. Student Interest Groups address this opportunity by facilitating the student group showcase, providing tools and resources for students to lead and manage their own organizations, and creating pathways for skill development in areas like event planning, communication, team management, leadership, and project coordination. Ultimately, SIGs and student leadership development programming like GLI enhances student retention, satisfaction, professional readiness, and overall university experience.",
        challenges: "Challenges mainly derive from our graduate students' short time with us as they complete their programs in 16-24 months, which can make for difficulty maintaining and transitioning committed student leadership for all SIGs. While Student Services works with each SIG to develop plans and execute programming, there can be a decline or fluctuation in student interest or engagement depending on the time of year and competing priorities for students, and we always strive to support and encourage student-led/driven initiatives and projects.",
        impact: "SIGs create a strong sense of belonging and community within our campus. Many graduate students arrive as newcomers to Canada or are transitioning into a new academic environment. SIGs provide them with an immediate network of peers who share similar interests and goals.  Beyond community building, SIGs have gained leadership development and practical skill-building. Graduate students who take on leadership roles within these groups gain hands-on experience in team management, event planning, budget oversight, and communication - skills that directly translate to their professional careers. Facilitating the Graduate Leadership Institute (GLI) on ground expands their skills and knowledge of what it takes to be a successful leader.",
        lessons_learned: "We would likely try to start earlier with collaborations across the campus team and global network to introduce more structured leadership development trainings and opportunities. Now that we have implemented a Canvas SIG Training and Leadership Development course, the on-ground GLI cohorts, leadership workshops and trainings, and collaborative career development programming, there are several ways for students to engage and develop themselves as student leaders. As we move forward, we will continue to collaborate more with other teams and departments to offer experiential learning and structured skill development opportunities for SIGs.",

Strategic Space Utilization: Growth was achieved primarily by maximizing activation of existing CAMD space rather than adding square footage—a testament to operational efficiency that also required thoughtful prioritization about which capabilities to expand as demand increased. This approach demonstrates the model's ability to deliver substantial value within controlled physical footprint.",
        impact: "Educational Transformation: The MSO eliminated departmental silos by integrating curricula from all six CAMD departments into shared facilities. Courses now converge in continuously activated spaces where students and faculty from different disciplines work side-by-side daily. This intentional proximity generates organic cross-pollination: students observe and adopt methodologies from adjacent disciplines, faculty discover collaborative research opportunities, and graduates develop fluency across multiple creative and technology-centered domains. This model demonstrates that curricular integration combined with shared infrastructure creates transformative learning outcomes that isolated departmental labs cannot achieve.  Research Acceleration: Faculty who previously lacked access to specialized equipment can now activate research immediately. The college's incredible growth in research funding demonstrates how the MSO removes barriers to competitive grant applications and enables collaborative, interdisciplinary research that attracts federal sponsors.  Financial Sustainability: The MSO generates multiple financial benefits: preventing redundant technology investments across departments, achieving economies of scale in procurement, and maximizing space utilization. The incredible growth in non-CAMD student revenue demonstrates market demand—students from other colleges enroll in CAMD courses to access MSO resources, creating sustainable revenue streams. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle where operational efficiency generates revenue, revenue enables infrastructure investment, and enhanced infrastructure attracts additional students and research funding.",
        lessons_learned: "More explicit formalization of cross-college fee-for-use and reinvestment protocols from the outset would have smoothed scaling challenges.  Implementing comprehensive usage analytics and assessment systems from launch, rather than building retrospectively, would have allowed earlier data reports for the college and university.  Developing formal industry partnerships once proof of concept was in place would have helped to generate non-tuition revenue streams earlier.",

        additional_info: "Success Requires Expert Staffing: Technology alone doesn't create transformation—expert staff who train students and faculty, maintain equipment, and facilitate projects and research are essential. Budget accordingly.  Curricular Integration Drives Activation: Facilities will not achieve meaningful utilization without intentional integration into curriculum. Before building or expanding spaces, identify specific courses that require them, measure existing demand, and secure faculty commitment to incorporate facilities into syllabi. The \"build it and they will come\" approach often fails—spaces achieve full activation only when embedded in academic programming.  Open Access Drives Sustainability: The willingness to serve students beyond the home college creates financial sustainability and university-wide value that protects investment during budget pressures.  Centralization Requires Cultural Change: Faculty and departments must embrace a shared resource model. This requires leadership commitment, transparent governance, and demonstrated benefits.  Start with Proof of Concept: Begin with consolidated facilities in high-demand areas (e.g., fabrication, production studios) to demonstrate value before expanding to a full ecosystem.  Measure Everything: Comprehensive usage data, financial metrics, and outcome tracking are essential for demonstrating value and securing continued investment.  Design for Scalability: Even if starting small, design operational systems (reservation platforms, training protocols, maintenance workflows) that can scale without complete redesign.  Plan for Technology Lifecycle: Creative technology evolves rapidly. Build equipment refresh cycles and technology sunset plans into operational model from the start."

Below I am adding the additional information from the student leader for the 2025 Health Fair, Sydney Snyder:   Every April, our chapter of Phi Delta Chi holds elections for all positions, including the Bouvé Health Fair head. Immediately after the elections, the planning begins! It starts slowly by reaching out to the faculty coordinators and starting to think about the previous years' events in the sense of what you want to do the same and what you want to change. After that comes the endless emails to potential sponsors. These start early and ultimately are the most time-consuming and one of the most important tasks to do. To make the event successful, we need to have products that help advertise and make the event more enticing. By starting early and sending individualized emails, we are usually able to get a substantial amount of donations from extremely generous companies.   Then the bulk of the planning kicks in when it is time to work with Northeastern Facilities to book the spaces for the event. This part takes a lot of communication with different offices at Northeastern to manage a lot of logistical efforts to make the event take place.   Also, around this time, we start to design the poster for the year; this is done in collaboration with our media E-board member, as well as our faculty advisors and the Bouvé marketing head. We work hard on the design to make it something that grasps people's attention; it plays a key role in the success of the event.   At the end of the summer, we reach out to student organizations and other health offices at NU and faculty-run organizations in hopes of getting presenters. The more presenters we are able to have, the better the experience. I believe we get a lot of foot traffic due to people needing vaccines, but these presenters really make the event lively, fun, and engaging to learn about pressing health topics and safety for undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and staff alike.   Lastly, organizing volunteers to staff the event on the day of, there is a lot of scrambling and setup that could certainly not be managed by one person. There are amazing volunteers from Phi Delta Chi as well as other organizations that help the fair go smoothly!  There is so much more that goes on behind the scenes, as well as a huge community of people who help plan and organize this event.

The challenge prepares students for today's global workplace while proving that geographic distance doesn't have to mean working in silos.",
        challenges: "The primary challenges have been logistical. Coordinating across 14 campuses means navigating different academic calendars and administrative processes. Time zones present a real challenge, scheduling meetings that work for Portland, Boston, London, and Miami requires careful planning. We've also had to build awareness from scratch since this is entirely new as students don't yet know this competition exists, and campus contacts are learning how to promote something that has no track record. Securing initial sponsorship without a proven model has required selling the vision before having concrete results to showcase.  Additionally, designing the virtual preliminary round to run smoothly across four regions simultaneously requires careful technical planning and clear processes that work for all participants. Budget planning for the May in-person showcase has been complex in determining travel costs when we don't know which specific campuses will have winning teams (a London student costs significantly more to bring to Portland than a Boston student) and estimating appropriate prize budgets without knowing final participation numbers. Finally, predicting student participation for a first-time event is difficult, making it hard to plan resources and prizes appropriately.",
        impact: "The most significant impact so far is demonstrating that Northeastern's 14 campuses can function as one connected innovation network rather than independent locations.

Second, build flexibility into every aspect of your model because what works at one location may need adjustment at another. Third, embrace the uncertainty.

The program is designed to provide students with core competencies, skills and perspectives to enable them to be transformational leaders for sustainability. The program is designed with three core courses, which will provide a strong cohort experience and shared understanding amongst students, followed by a wide range of concentrations across disciplines. CSSH has designed one of the core courses: PPUA 5XXX: Sustainability Foundations in Strategy and Policy, which equips aspiring sustainability professionals with the frameworks and tools needed to translate sustainability goals into actionable strategies and effective policies. It traces the evolution of sustainable development from its historical foundations to contemporary challenges, exploring how strategic visioning, stakeholder engagement, and policy interventions can drive long-term transformation. It also examines critical tensions inherent in sustainability work, including managing trade-offs between natural resource protection and human needs, navigating diverse—and often competing—stakeholder interests, and identifying the funding challenges and opportunities for sustainability priorities. Finally, the course helps students build analytical and practical skills to design, advocate for, and implement sustainability strategies that bridge vision and reality. The CSSH concentrations delve deeper into each one of these skills within experiential courses, so students graduate with breadth and depth of knowledge as well as practice, enabling them to hit the ground running as transformative sustainability professionals.   To develop the CSSH core course and concentrations, we worked closely with faculty in the Policy School, the Dean’s office, and the Provost office sustainability coordinator.",

By designing this program from the ground up as an interdisciplinary program focused on core competencies and skills for sustainability professionals, the program will empower students to make significant impacts in the professional world. They will be able to look at sustainability challenges from a systems-level perspective, balancing technical expertise with cultural competencies, critical thinking, and a deep understanding of underlying socio-economic, political, technological, and environmental forces shaping solutions.

First-generation college students face significantly higher dropout rates – approximately one quarter of first-generation students who enter four-year colleges do not return after their first year. This attrition is even more pronounced in STEM fields, where first-generation students leave STEM fields at higher rates than their counterparts and first-generation students are underrepresented in STEM fields, constituting around 25% of STEM majors despite making up 35% of undergraduates.  The Hellman Experiential Science Program was established to address this critical retention challenge by providing first-generation students with peer mentorship, community support, and practical skill development. Research demonstrates that mentoring relationships are especially crucial for first-generation college students in the sciences, helping them develop a sense of belonging and more positive science identities, which are key for retention and success. Studies show that near-peer mentorship programs result in improved academic performance and retention, with mentees approximately two times more likely to continue in their major course sequences. By combining graduate student mentorship with targeted workshops addressing the unique challenges first-generation students face, from navigating institutional systems to managing financial pressures, the program creates a comprehensive support system designed to retain and diversify STEM majors.",
        challenges: "Recruiting graduate student mentors who are both available and well-matched to our undergraduate scholars has been somewhat challenging. Once matched, ensuring mentors feel adequately prepared and confident in their mentoring role requires ongoing training and support.

        description: "The InStage AI Reflection Tool project pilots a voice-based, AI-guided reflection experience within co-op and work-integrated learning programs to help students engage in deeper, more intentional learning during their work terms. Students complete structured reflection conversations (goal setting, mid-term check-ins, and wrap-ups) using the AI tool, which prompts critical thinking, skill articulation, and self-awareness. Advisors and faculty review AI-generated summaries, allowing for early intervention and targeted support without significantly increasing staff workload. The project demonstrates how AI can scale high-quality reflection, improve learning outcomes, and save substantial advising time while maintaining pedagogical integrity.",
        problem_opportunity: "This innovation addresses the long-standing challenge of scaling high-quality, pedagogically sound reflection in co-op and work-integrated learning programs. Traditional 1:1 reflective coaching is time-intensive and difficult to deliver equitably across large student populations, often resulting in inconsistent reflection quality or missed opportunities for early intervention. The InStage AI Reflection Tool creates an opportunity to provide every student with structured, guided reflective practice—supporting self-awareness, skill development, and goal setting—while significantly reducing advisor workload. In doing so, it enables earlier identification of students who may need additional support and preserves the educational integrity of reflection at scale.",
        challenges: "Several challenges have emerged through the pilot phases, primarily related to technology, adoption, and change management. On the technical side, students experienced occasional platform access issues, voice-recognition inaccuracies, and confusion related to transcripts or AI “hallucinations,” which required additional support and clear troubleshooting protocols. From an adoption perspective, some students were initially skeptical of AI-led reflection or did not engage with the process as seriously as they would a live advisor conversation, affecting completion rates in certain programs. Finally, scaling the pilot surfaced integration and governance challenges, including limited system integration (e.g., single sign-on, LMS alignment), the need for clearer intervention protocols around flagged comments, and ensuring consistent communication so students understood the purpose and value of the reflection experience.",
        impact: "The most significant impact so far has been the ability to deliver high-quality, meaningful reflection at scale without increasing staff workload, fundamentally changing how co-op and work-integrated learning programs support students. Students overwhelmingly prefer the conversational, voice-based format, which has led to deeper reflection, clearer goal-setting, and measurable gains in competencies such as critical thinking and communication. At the same time, advisors gain actionable, real-time insight through summaries and flagged comments, enabling earlier intervention and more targeted support. Collectively, this has shifted reflection from a compliance activity to a core, high-impact learning practice that is scalable, equitable, and sustainable across campuses and programs.",
        lessons_learned: "If starting over, we would take a more intentional, phased approach to implementation and change management. This would include investing earlier in technical readiness—such as tighter system integrations, clearer onboarding materials, and more robust testing—to reduce access and usability issues. We would also spend more time upfront aligning expectations with students and advisors, clearly positioning the tool as a coaching and learning experience rather than a compliance task, and embedding it more explicitly into course and co-op requirements. Finally, we would establish clearer protocols from the outset for interpreting flagged comments, escalating concerns, and using reflection data consistently across programs, ensuring the tool’s early-alert and equity potential is fully realized from day one.",

Operationally, the pilots demonstrated significant efficiency gains, saving approximately 88 advisor hours in Pilot 1 and over 250 hours in Pilot 2, while enabling earlier identification of students needing support through flagged comments and summaries. Pilot 3 scaled the model to 400+ undergraduate and graduate students across multiple colleges, confirming both scalability and consistency of outcomes across programs and campuses.",
        success_metrics: "Student learning and development: Demonstrated growth in targeted competencies (e.g., critical thinking, communication, self-management), high goal completion rates across reflection cycles, and students’ improved ability to articulate learning and skills from their work-integrated experiences.  Engagement and equity: Sustained high participation and completion rates across cohorts and programs, strong student preference for oral reflection, and consistent engagement across undergraduate and graduate populations, indicating the model works equitably at scale.  Early intervention and support: Effective use of flagged comments and summaries to identify students needing additional support earlier in the work term, with timely advisor follow-up.  Operational efficiency and scalability: Measurable reductions in advisor time spent on 1:1 reflection meetings, successful scaling across campuses and colleges without loss of quality, and seamless integration into existing co-op and experiential learning workflows.  Institutional and employer value: Clear evidence that reflection data informs program improvement, strengthens students’ workplace readiness, and supports employer-facing outcomes such as stronger communication, professionalism, and reflective practice.",
        additional_info: "One key insight for teams considering a similar innovation is that AI does not replace reflection pedagogy—it amplifies it. The success of this work depended on grounding the technology in clear learning outcomes, intentional reflection design, and strong advisor judgment. Voice-based reflection proved especially powerful for students who struggle with written expression, second-language writers, or those who benefit from conversational sense-making, making this approach both more inclusive and more human-centered than traditional methods.  Equally important is treating implementation as an organizational change effort, not just a technology pilot. Clear communication, advisor buy-in, student framing, and defined intervention protocols are essential. Starting with a focused pilot, using data to iterate quickly, and co-designing with an external partner who understands higher education and work-integrated learning contexts made it possible to scale responsibly. For institutions willing to pair strong pedagogy with thoughtful AI use, this model offers a practical, evidence-based pathway to transforming reflection at scale."

        description: "The Embedded Partner Ecosystem at Northeastern University Vancouver is a campus-wide partnership model that shifts industry engagement from one-off, transactional interactions to continuous, embedded collaboration. Industry partners are integrated into the academic and co-curricular fabric of the campus through dedicated space, regular presence, curriculum input, mentorship, and hands-on project engagement with students and faculty. This ecosystem connects students to real-world industry challenges through embedded studios, capstone projects, hackathons, and on-demand talent opportunities, while enabling partners to access diverse, job-ready talent and emerging ideas. The model has demonstrated scalable impact, with high-frequency partner engagement, measurable value creation, and strong alignment with British Columbia’s innovation and startup ecosystem. The model has been expanded and adopted at the Toronto campus.",
        problem_opportunity: "The Embedded Partner Ecosystem addresses the structural limitations of traditional university–industry engagement models that are transactional, episodic, and difficult to scale equitably. In these models, partnerships are often reactive, dependent on individual relationships, and concentrated around a small subset of employers, resulting in inconsistent access to experiential learning, limited employer trust, and weak talent pipelines—particularly in a tight labour market for new graduates.  This innovation responds to the opportunity to create a durable, ecosystem-based partnership infrastructure that embeds industry directly into the academic environment. By formalizing expectations through collaboration agreements, using time rather than funding as the primary currency of exchange, and anchoring engagement in a shared physical and social campus space, the model enables sustained, high-frequency collaboration that benefits students, employers, and faculty alike. It expands access for startups and emerging organizations, strengthens employer confidence in student talent, and allows the university to deliver scalable, high-impact experiential learning even under resource constraints, while aligning closely with British Columbia’s innovation and technology ecosystem",
        challenges: "Implementing the Embedded Partner Ecosystem has required navigating several structural, cultural, and operational challenges typical of system-level innovation in higher education.  1. Shifting Mindsets from Transactional to Ecosystem-Based Engagement One of the earliest challenges was helping both internal and external stakeholders move away from familiar, event-driven or one-off partnership models. Building understanding that value accrues over time through sustained presence, trust, and reciprocity required intentional communication, proof of concept, and patience.  2. Resource Constraints During Scale-Up The ecosystem expanded during a period of staffing reductions, budget pressure, and a difficult labor market for new graduates. Designing systems and processes that could scale partner and student engagement without proportional increases in staffing required significant upfront investment in operational design and prioritization.  3. Balancing Depth of Engagement with Breadth of Demand As partner interest grew, managing demand while preserving the quality and integrity of embedded relationships became a challenge. Not all partners were immediately ready for the level of commitment required, necessitating clearer expectations, tiered engagement pathways, and selective onboarding.  4. Institutional Integration and Alignment Embedding industry directly into academic space required close coordination across campus operations, facilities, legal, academic units, and experiential learning teams. Aligning timelines, policies, and risk considerations while maintaining momentum required strong cross-functional collaboration.  5. Measurement and Change Management Capturing meaningful data that reflects ecosystem depth—rather than simple activity counts—required new metrics, tracking mechanisms, and cultural shifts in how success is defined and reported.  Despite these challenges, each has informed refinements to governance, onboarding, metrics, and partner selection, strengthening the ecosystem’s sustainability and readiness for further scale.",
        impact: "The most significant impact has been the successful shift from transactional, one-off partnerships to a sustained, high-frequency embedded ecosystem, fundamentally changing how students, industry, and the university engage with one another.  1. Durable, High-Trust Industry Engagement  • Partners are no longer occasional participants but deeply integrated collaborators, with 41 partners engaging weekly or more frequently and 64 organizations formally embedded in the ecosystem.  • This level of consistency signals trust, mutual value, and a move away from relationship fragility tied to individual events or staff    2. Expanded and More Equitable Student Access to Real-World Experience  • Hundreds of students now engage annually through embedded studios, capstone/XN projects, hackathons, mentorship, and co-op pathways—many with organizations that would not typically participate in traditional recruitment models.  • The time-as-currency approach has significantly increased participation from startups and small businesses, broadening access to industry exposure and social capital for students    3. Demonstrated Scale and Growth Under Resource Constraints  • Embedded partners grew 875% from 2023 to 2025, and industry-sponsored academic projects increased from 0 to 26 in two years.  • These outcomes were achieved without proportional increases in staffing, demonstrating that the ecosystem functions as scalable institutional infrastructure, not a resource-intensive pilot   4. Measurable Institutional and Economic Value  • The ecosystem generated $194,000 in quantified value through partner engagement and experiential activity.  • Strategic shifts toward deeper engagement led to 120% growth in BaseCamp Studio participation, 116% growth in mentorship hours, and a 38% increase in placements, despite a challenging labor market .  Overall, the most significant impact is that Northeastern University Vancouver has proven a new partnership operating model works—one that delivers consistent student outcomes, earns sustained employer commitment, and remains resilient and scalable in uncertain economic conditions.",
        lessons_learned: "If starting over, the primary change would be to design for scale, governance, and shared understanding earlier, rather than allowing the model to emerge organically before formalizing its structure.  1. Establish a Clear Ecosystem Narrative from Day One Earlier articulation of the shift from transactional partnerships to an embedded ecosystem—including clear language, visuals, and success metrics—would have accelerated internal and external buy-in and reduced early confusion about expectations and commitment levels.  2. Formalize Partner Tiers and Readiness Earlier Introducing tiered engagement pathways and readiness criteria at the outset would have helped partners self-select into appropriate levels of involvement, preserving depth while managing demand and preventing misalignment in early-stage partnerships.  3. Build Measurement Infrastructure Upfront Implementing ecosystem-specific metrics and data tracking systems earlier would have made it easier to demonstrate impact in real time and support evidence-based decision-making during the initial growth phase.  4. Invest Earlier in Cross-Functional Alignment More structured early engagement with academic leadership, campus operations, legal, and facilities teams would have reduced friction and rework as the ecosystem scaled, particularly around space use, governance, and timelines.  5. Protect Capacity for Strategic Design Allocating dedicated time earlier for systems design and long-term planning—rather than building while simultaneously delivering at scale—would have reduced pressure during periods of rapid growth and staffing constraints.  Overall, starting with clear governance, shared language, and measurement infrastructure would have accelerated maturity while preserving the organic relationship-building that ultimately made the ecosystem successful.",

        additional_info: "1. Treat Partnerships as Infrastructure, Not Programming The most important mindset shift is to design industry engagement as institutional infrastructure rather than a collection of programs or events. This means investing in shared language, governance, space, and measurement systems so partnerships can compound over time and remain resilient to staffing changes or market volatility.  2. Design for Trust, Not Transactions Depth matters more than volume. Fewer, high-quality partnerships with clear expectations and consistent touchpoints generate far more value for students and employers than a high number of episodic engagements. Trust, built through reliability and reciprocity, is the core currency of an ecosystem model.  3. Lower Barriers to Participation Through “Time as Currency” Using time, mentorship, and presence—rather than financial sponsorship—as the primary exchange mechanism dramatically expands who can participate. This approach increases equity, brings startups and emerging organizations into the ecosystem, and exposes students to innovation environments they would otherwise never access.  4. Start Small, but Design for Scale Pilots are useful, but only if they are designed with future scale in mind. Establish simple governance structures, clear engagement pathways, and outcome metrics early, even if participation starts modestly.  5. Expect Culture Change to Take Time Moving from transactional to ecosystem-based engagement requires unlearning old habits—for staff, faculty, and partners. Progress accelerates once early wins are visible, but patience and consistent storytelling are essential in the early phases.  Ultimately, the success of this innovation lies not in any single program, space, or metric, but in the intentional alignment of people, structure, and purpose. Institutions willing to invest in that alignment can build partnership ecosystems that deliver durable value for students, industry, and the university alike."

        description: "At NUL’s Computational Philosophy Lab (https://cpl.northeastern.edu) - launched in May 2025 - my colleagues and I are pioneering new interdisciplinary methods at the intersection of philosophy and computing (especially artificial intelligence), teaching them to students, and actively pursuing external research, industry, and civil society collaborations that draw on the knowledge they produce. This work began in 2020 when, as Head of Philosophy, I volunteered to integrate Computer Science as a discipline within my Faculty. I applied for, and was awarded, London’s first external research grant (an APEX Award from the Royal Society) for the PolyGraphs project (https://polygraphs.sites.northeastern.edu), which uses computer simulations to explore the effects of mis/disinformation in our AI-mediated informational environment. At the same time, I launched two of our most successful masters in London, our MA in Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence, and its sister programme, now called MSc AI and Ethics. At the same time, we have pursued dialogue and collaboration with industry and civil society in this area, so as to create a virtuous feedback cycle between theory and practice – for example, launching the interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral Conversations on AI (https://conversationsonai.org) event series in 2023 and expanding to new industry-partnered series (e.g. AI Beyond the Hype) in 2025.",
        problem_opportunity: "On the one hand, recent advances in AI present an opportunity for philosophy to pursue new methods: the computational tools that are available now are extremely powerful; yet they are typically underexploited within the discipline (which has been slow to adopt even the more traditional methods of digital humanities practice). At the same time, the ubiquity of AI applications has generated a wide-ranging need for philosophically informed practical ethics in relation to both the development, and the deployment, of such systems; and it has presented a new opportunity for insights from other areas of philosophy (such as the philosophy of mind and the theory of knowledge) to make their way (back) into the science and engineering of AI. (It has been argued that Alan Turing, for example, was a philosopher-mathematician just like Rene Descartes.)",
        challenges: "Getting to grips with the thorny details of computational implementation (e.g. programming, using HPC) has been tricky for me as a philosopher, despite my understanding of the mathematics of logic and computation. And securing adequate financial support in London where we are still ineligible to apply to the primary source of research grants in the UK has also been tough. As our record shows, we have been very successful in getting pots of money where they are available. In short, there’s an appetite for our innovative approach!",
        impact: "The masters programmes have perhaps had the most deep impact at scale so far. But the research is being recognized (e.g. PolyGraphs will be used in an Australian Future Leaders Fellowship, Cognia are looking to deepen their partnership with us). And the external collaborations have huge potential: as just one example, I have contributed to the training materials in IT and AI ethics for the British Computing Society – and they have a large, and international membership.",

We empower our Program Directors to handle the full range of advising needs while keeping them fully supported and informed by professional advisors. The result? Students get a seamless experience with one trusted point of contact for everything from course selection to career planning.  Our success comes through collaboration and intensive training. Professional advisors and program directors meet monthly and advisors participate in curriculum meetings, ensuring everyone stays aligned. For 2,500 graduate students across 40+ program options (including Plus One and other program pathways) this model delivers high-quality, personalized advising that maximizes our existing resources and puts student experience first.",
        problem_opportunity: "Graduate students consistently told us they were frustrated by \"the shuffle\", being passed from office to office to resolve a single issue. When they reached out to faculty with a problem, they would be directed to an advisor. The advisor would send them to the program directors or to other university offices. We saw this complaint surface repeatedly in university surveys, college surveys, point-of-service surveys, during our student leadership council meetings, on the NU SubReddit, and through other feedback channels. It was not just inconvenient, it was impacting student trust and overall satisfaction with their degree program.  With limited resources to expand our professional advising staff, we asked a different question: How can we empower the program directors that students already trust to handle their needs comprehensively and refer only when the requests are truly out of their scope? Our innovative advising program equips faculty with intensive training including case studies of common scenarios, a Canvas course with all of the resources professional advisors use, and ongoing support from professional advisors, so they feel confident addressing the full spectrum of student concerns. The goal is simple: eliminate the shuffle and give students one knowledgeable point of contact who can actually solve their problems.",

        impact: "The most significant impact has been improved student satisfaction, students now get their issues resolved by their first point of contact instead of being shuffled between offices. We have also built a stronger, more collaborative partnership between the Office of Student Services (OSS) and the academic program directors who now operate as a unified team. While program director turnover requires ongoing training for new program directors, this has become an asset that keeps our approach refined and consistent. What started as a resource constraint has transformed into a distinctive advising model that strengthens both student outcomes and cross-departmental collaboration.",

        challenges: "Mindset shift: Initially, apprenticeships were viewed as a distinct program type rather than an institutional capability. Recognizing our competency assessment frameworks as transferable assets required reframing how we understood our own expertise.

In 2021, based on the findings of a needs assessment, the clinic decided to expand their services so to better address the unmet health needs of the community. We partnered with the clinic shortly after that decision was made, and our collaboration has taken many forms. Initially, we were able to place one of the Roux Institute’s pre-clinical Gap year participants in the clinic, where they filled a much-needed dental assistant role. Then in fall 2023, we were able to transfer ownership of the Bouvé College of Health Sciences mobile health bus to the clinic for use in their efforts to bring services to some of the county’s harder to reach communities. The mobile bus was in need of refurbishment and rebranding, and so faculty and students from the College of Arts Media and Design, as well as Health Equity Interns from the University’s Institute for Health Equity and Social Justice Research, and the Roux Institute were recruited to help in all aspects of this work, from removing the old exterior wrap to developing new designs to installing new flooring, cabinets, lighting and doors to conducting interviews with community stakeholders to inform the deployment plan for the bus. In fall of 2024, the clinic also purchased a brick-and-mortar facility as the future home for their expanded services.

        problem_opportunity: "This innovation expands experiential learning by providing students with real-world opportunities and support in developing, pitching, and implementing entrepreneurial ideas. It translates learning into practical business skills, such as Enactus addressing community issues, including food insecurity, environmental sustainability, and economic inclusion. By supporting student-led initiatives, the campus creates a pathway for new entrepreneurs to gain hands-on experience, build confidence, and make meaningful impact.",
        challenges: "One of the biggest challenges shared by the student leaders has been getting restaurants to trust and partner with them as a new student-led group. Many restaurant owners were hesitant because they weren't sure how the platform would work or if students could reliably manage it. Additionally, they have also faced difficulties in spreading awareness among students and getting them to regularly use the services available instead of their usual food options. Despite these challenges, Enactus learned to build trust through consistent communication and delivering on promises.",
        impact: "Enactus' biggest impact has been through their project Second Plate, which reduces food waste and helps people (students) afford meals. They rescued over 419 meals from being thrown in the trash and saved more than 126 kg of good food from going to waste. They also helped students and community members save over $2,500 by offering them cheaper meal options. Beyond these numbers, Enactus changed how local restaurants and students think about leftover food—they now see it as valuable instead of waste.",
        lessons_learned: "The students have shared that if starting over, they would prepare stronger marketing techniques, knowing that social media has a lot of reach and can increase volume of sales and engagement with more students across the community.",
        recognition: "Enactus Northeastern competed at Enactus Canada Regionals where they won the TD Entrepreneurship Competition, qualifying them for the national competition in Calgary. This was a historic achievement for Northeastern University Toronto, as it was the first time the institution competed at nationals, advancing them to the semifinals. At the national level, Enactus became National Semi-Finalists, placing in the Top 20 teams across Canada. Enactus also received three prestigious awards: Best Rookie Team.",
